# observatory
[CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft) node monitoring that polls RPC endpoints for chainstate. 
## Run
First setup `observatory.toml`, check out [this full config example](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/observatory/blob/main/observatory.toml.example).
Fill in the config with your validator's consensus key address and the chains you want to monitor. There's an [optional Datadog config](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/observatory/blob/main/observatory.toml.example#L49) that integrates with Pagerduty.

```toml
[[chain]]
id = "cosmoshub-4"
validator_addr = "95E060D07713070FE9822F6C50BD76BCCBF9F17A"
rpc_urls = [
"https://cosmos-rpc.polkachu.com/",
"https://cosmoshub.validator.network/",
]
```

After you setup the config, run the following cmd `cargo run -- start`
